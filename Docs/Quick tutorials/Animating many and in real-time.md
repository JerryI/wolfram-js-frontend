Bind an event, generated by Plotly via frontened.
See an example https://plotly.com/javascript/animations/

in general it would look like
```mathematica
ListLinePlotly[init, "RequestAnimationFrame"->{event, reply}]
```

==and it goes even without [[Frontend objects]]==
internal event binding

```mathematica
EventBind[event, Function[data,
  (* compute *)
  reply[data];
]]
```
