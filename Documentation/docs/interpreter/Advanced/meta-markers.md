# Meta markers
You can think about them as a unique property assigned to the expression in order to use selectors on them. Sometimes it comes handy to attach or evaluate new object inside the existing instance

```mathematica
FrontEndVirtual[{
	(* attach a dom element to draw *)
    AttachDOM["canvas"], 
    (* mark this instance by uid *)
    Graphics[{PointSize[0.02], MetaMarker["plot"]}] 
}]; 
```

Here we marked this instance and `{}` scope with `plot` marker. Then, one can evaluate an arbitrary function on the place of this marker using `FrontSubmit` expression

```mathematica
FrontSubmit[Point[RandomReal[{- 1,1}, 2]], MetaMarker["plot"]]
```

Then, a point will appear on the corresponding place. Repeating this process over and over we can populate with any graphical object our existing plot even with dynamic binding.

### ðŸŽ¡ Example
Lets draw some random lines, where each line has a dynamic variable, that specifies the beginning, while the end will be a random fixed value

<details>

```mathematica
(* to be able to animate we need a container *)
FrontEndVirtual[{
	(* attach a dom element to draw *)
    AttachDOM["canvas"], 
    (* mark this instance by uid *)
    Graphics[{PointSize[0.02], MetaMarker["plot"]}] 
}];     

j = 0; 
(* now we can directly inject new points into already existing object *)
last = {0,0};

While[j < 300,         
 With[{try = RandomReal[{- 1,1}, 2]},    
  FrontSubmit[{
    RGBColor[RandomSample[{{1,0,0}, {0,1,1}, {1,0,1}}]//First],    
    Line[{last, try}]
  }, MetaMarker["plot"]];  
 
  last = try;  
 ];   
  
 Pause[0.5];
 j = j + 1;
]; 
```

As one can see, an expression inside `Placed` will be evaluated inside the instance found by the meta-marker. `last` variable is global, therefore it causes a dynamic update of all added lines.

This will lead to the following results
