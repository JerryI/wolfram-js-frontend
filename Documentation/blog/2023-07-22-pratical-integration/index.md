I would like to start this series of application cases, where I am going to solve real-life problems I face using WLJS Frontend. Since my main area is quantum physics, it will be more focused on the scientific research field.

You may think about notebooks as a sort of small apps. Useful, minimalistic and reactive with respect to the input data. I have been using Origin Pro for processing data for quite a long, however among of all scientific tools, most of them suffer from poor GUI. Looking at GUI of modern VST EQ plugins makes me envy, since there is nothing more clear and than dragging a pointer and seeing the result in the real-time.

Today I will try to bring those ideas to live in a one short example
