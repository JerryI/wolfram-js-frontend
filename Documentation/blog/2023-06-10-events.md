One of the paradigm of WLJS Frontend is an event-based approach. Any sliders, buttons are event generators, that produce `EventObject[<|...|>]`. In order to simplify or mimic Mathematica's way of binding symbols to input elements `Assign` keyword was introduced.

Instead of 

```mathematica
InputRange[0,1, 0.1]
EventHandler[%, Function[data, x = data]]
```

one can write

```mathematica
InputRange[0,1, 0.1] // Assign[x]
```

The result will be the same

Going further, one should note, that 

:::info
`EventHandler` or `Assign` returns the same object `EventObject[<||>]` as it has on input. On cell's output `EventObject[<|"view"->...|>]` a field `view` will be displayed by automatic converting it into `FrontEndExecutable`.
