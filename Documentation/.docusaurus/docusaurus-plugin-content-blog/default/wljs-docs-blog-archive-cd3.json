Many sandboxes, such as Codepen, RunJS, ReplIT has this option to use NodeJS in the browser. Why don't we have this feature as well?\n\n[__wljs-esm-support__](https://github.com/JerryI/wljs-esm-support) plugin\n\n<!--truncate-->\n## Bundling on-fly\nThe idea is, you have `node` installed on your system and Wolfram Kernel runs an external process\n\n```mathematica\nRunProcess[{\"node\", ...}, Stdin]\n```\n\nusing some bundler, that support `stdin` method to process the file data instead of actual file. The only one I found is ESBuild. In principle, then, one can feed the content of any cell to it and get the data back to the output cell as a bundled JS file.\n\n## Helper functions\nIt would be nice to have a simple interface to interact with Node, therefore, I created a special object for that\n\n```mathematica\nNPM[\"name-of-a-package\"] // Install \n```\nwhich will install locally to the vault folder a module from npm repository. \n\n## Example\nLet us try the simples possible example. For instance you found a nice package for making fireworks inside your notebook [js-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-confetti)\n\nThen you type\n```mathematica\nNPM[\"js-confetti\"] // Install\n```\n\nAnd finally our `.esm` cell\n```js\n.esm\n\nimport JSConfetti from 'js-confetti'\nconst jsConfetti = new JSConfetti()\njsConfetti.addConfetti();\n\nconst re = document.createElement('span');\nre.innerText = \"everything is fine!\";\n\nthis.onreturn = () => {\n  return re;\n}\n```\n\nWhen you evaluate it, it compiles JS file and embeds the result to the output cell.\n\n## Nintendo Pro controller & Wolfram Engine\nThis is rather much funnier example. It is known fact, any JS app can interact with gamepads, controllers connected via USB or Bluetooth channel. \n\nWhy not use it to communicate to Wolfram Kernel? 😵‍💫\nThe overhead from translating the signals OS $\\rightarrow$ V8 engine seems to be minimal.\n\n### Reading signals\n\n```mathematica\nNPM[\"switch-pro\"] // Install \n```\n\n```js\n.esm\nimport SwitchPro from 'switch-pro'\n\nconst switchPro = new SwitchPro(window)\n\nswitchPro.addListener((pressed) => {\n  server.emitt('joy', `\"${JSON.stringify(pressed).replaceAll(/\"/g, \"'\")}\"`);\n});\n\ncore.Rumble = async () => {\n  switchPro.vibrate();\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is super easy, we just redirect all events to WL kernel as JSON string with some minor changes in order to escape double quotes.\n\n:::note\nA library `switch-pro` automatically discovers Pro controller and connects to it. No actions are needed.\n:::\n\nThe last line `Rumble` is to \"vibrate\" our controller just for fun. We will use it later.\n\n### Handling signals\n\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[\"joy\", handler];\n```\n\nNow we attached an event-handler to the events from Nintendo controller. Let us decrypt JSON and send it to some plot\n\n```mathematica\npoint =  {0,0};\nhandler = Function[cmd,\n  Module[{assoc = ImportString[StringReplace[cmd, \"'\"->\"\\\"\"], \"JSON\"] // Association, p = point},\n    If[KeyExistsQ[assoc, \"RS-DOWN\"], p = {p[[1]], -assoc[\"RS-DOWN\"]}];\n    If[KeyExistsQ[assoc, \"RS-UP\"], p = {p[[1]], assoc[\"RS-UP\"]}];\n    If[KeyExistsQ[assoc, \"RS-LEFT\"], p = {-assoc[\"RS-LEFT\"], p[[2]]}];\n    If[KeyExistsQ[assoc, \"RS-RIGHT\"], p = {assoc[\"RS-RIGHT\"], p[[2]]}]; \n\n    If[Length[Keys[assoc]] == 0, p = {0,0}];\n\n    point = p;\n  ]\n];\n\nGraphics[{Red, PointSize[0.1], Point[point // Offload]}, TransitionDuration->50, TransitionType->\"Linear\"]\n```\n\nThis code looks a bit sketchy, the decoding could be done in a much more efficient manner.\nDo not forget about rumbling! But this is no-brainer\n\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[InputButton[\"Rumble\"], Function[Null, FrontSubmit[Rumble[]]]] \n```\n\nThe result you can see in the video\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qhG6PV4NZeA?si=a4wuC7KGR25FZo6I\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nYou can download the notebook using the link in the bottom\n- [__NintendoPro__](NintendoPro.wln)"

Here it is way more simplified compared to JS, but covers all practical cases.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Thumb rule\n\nOne event-object - one handler function\n\n```mathematica\nev = EventObject[<|\"id\"->\"evid\", ...|>]\nEventHandler[ev, Print]\n```\n\ni.e.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n\nsubgraph EventObject\n\tid=evid\n\t...\nend\n\nsubgraph EventHandler\n\tPrint\nend\n\nEventObject --\"By id\"-->EventHandler\n```\n\nto remove our handler\n```mathematica\nDelete[ev]\n```\nwhere it deletes a handler function, but not an `EventObject`.\n\n:::tip\nTo assign more event handlers, you need to __clone an event object__ \n:::\n### Cloning events\nConsidering the previous example we had\n\n```mathematica\nev = EventObject[<|\"id\"->\"evid\", ...|>]\n(* first handler *)\nEventHandler[ev, Print]; \n\n(* second handler *)\nclone = EventClone[ev];\nEventHandler[clone, Print];\n```\n\nWhat it does, it converts a simple `EventObject` into something like an event router, which is populated by two new event-objects\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n\nsubgraph EventObject\n\tid=evid\n\tprop1[\"props\"]\nend\n\nsubgraph EventRouter\n\tsubgraph List\n\t\tid=new1\n\t\tid=new2\n\tend\n\tprop2[\"props\"]\nend\n\nsubgraph EventHandler1[EventHandler]\n\tPrint1[Print]\nend\n\nsubgraph EventHandler2[EventHandler]\n\tPrint2[Print]\nend\n\nEventObject --\"By id\"--> EventRouter\n\nid=new1 --\"By id\"-->EventHandler1\nid=new2 --\"By id\"-->EventHandler2\n```\n\nAnything you do with `clone` will not affect the `ev`\n\n```mathematica\nDelete[clone]\n```\n\n:::info\nCloned object inherits all properties (i.e. initial data), that the original object has.\n:::\n\n## Merging\nFor example you want to update the state of something based on two events, that may happen independently, then\n\n```mathematica\nev1 = EventObject[<|\"id\"->\"evid1\"|>]\nev2 = EventObject[<|\"id\"->\"evid2\"|>]\n\njoined = Join[ev1, ev2]\n```\n\n:::tip\nYou do not have to clone your events before joining them, since it does it automatically keeping all other connections intact\n:::\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n\nsubgraph EventObject1[EventObject]\n\tid=evid1\n\tprop1[\"props1\"]\nend\n\nsubgraph EventObject2[EventObject]\n\tid=evid2\n\tprop2[\"props2\"]\nend\n\nsubgraph EventRouter\nend\n\nsubgraph EventObject3[EventObject]\n\tid=new\n\tprop3[\"merged props\"]\nend\n\nEventObject1 --> EventRouter\nEventObject2 --> EventRouter\n\nEventRouter --Fire--> EventObject3\n```\n## Properties\nThere is a simple association wrapped inside `EventObject`. By its nature this is not a classical object in the sense of OOP, since the handler function has no access to the their properties and only `id`  field is stored in global a memory. \n### Inheritable\nThere is a property `\"initial\"`, that specifies the initial value of the data shipped when the event is fired, when you apply `Join` or `EventClone` the final initial conditions will be merged from the different event objects or just copied\n\n```mathematica\nev1 = EventObject[<|\"id\"->\"ev1\", \"initial\"-><|\"x\"->1|>|>]\nev2 = EventObject[<|\"id\"->\"ev1\", \"initial\"-><|\"y\"->2|>|>]\n\nJoin[ev1, ev2]\n```\n\nthe result will be\n\n```mathematica\nEventObject[<|\"id\"->\"random\", \"initial\"-><|\"x\"->1, \"y\"->2|>|>]\n```\n### Non-inheritable\nA very useful property, that comes handy when making GUI elements `\"view\"`\n\n```mathematica\nEventObject[<|\"id\"->\"evid\", \"view\"->Graphics3D[Sphere[]]|>]\n```\n\nit acts only when the object is printed to the output cell, then, we will see\n\n\n\nThis is where the *body* of all input elements is located.\n## Applications\nThe most interesting part is coming below\n### Event listener for Graphics\nAn `EventHandler` expression always returns the original object, therefore it comes very handy to use it as a wrapper for buttons, sliders and most `Graphics` objects\n\n```mathematica\np = {0,0};\nGraphics[{\n\tWhite,\n\tEventHandler[\n\t\tRectangle[{-2,2}, {2,-2}],\n\t\t{\"mousemove\"->Function[xy, p = xy]}\n\t],\n\tPointSize[0.05], Cyan,\n\tPoint[p // Offload]\n}]\n```\n\nHere we are listening for `mousemove` event attached to a wide white rectangle and translate the coordinates to a cyan point.\n\n:::info\nAn event-handling functions must be in __a list of rules__ with corresponding names of the events for `EventHandler` being attached to a standard graphical object\n\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[GraphicsPrimitive_, {\"\"->...}]\n```\nI.e. the following\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[GraphicsPrimitive_, Print]\n```\n__will not work__, because `Point` does produce only named events\n:::\n\nThere are following event available for 2D primitives\n- drag\n- mousemove\n- click\n- zoom\n\nand for 3D primitives\n- transform - similar to drag, but with gizmos \n\n### Cells events\nIt comes handy, when you for instance clone events and need to purge the handlers before each reevaluation. There is an access to any output cell via\n\n```mathematica\nEvaluationCell[]\n```\n\nThen, one can assign any expression to it\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[EvaluationCell[], {\"destroy\"->Print, \"evaluation\"->Print}]\n```\n\nOne should not that those event are assigned to __the output cell__ generated after the evaluation. Therefore mostly useful will be to use `\"destroy\"`, while `\"evaluation\"` is called only if one tries to evaluate the output cell as an input cell.\n\n### GUI elements\nThe most common place to deal with `EventObject`s is\n\n```mathematica\nInputButton[\"Click me\"]\n```\n\nthat evaluates into \n```mathematica\nEventObject[<|\"id\"->\"generated...\", \"view\"->ButtonView[...], \"initial\"->False|>]\n```\n\nbut __you will never see it__, because on output it shows only `view` field, that contains actual representation of a button as an interactive object, that fires an event with `id`. \n### Javascript binding\nThink about it as a superset of the previous one. Let us try with an example of a...\n\nButton\n```javascript\n.js\nconst button = document.createElement('input');\nbutton.type = \"button\";\nbutton.value = \"Click me\";\nbutton.addEventListener('click', ()=>{\n  server.emitt('evid', '\"Clicked!\"');\n});\n\nreturn button;\n```\n\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[\"evid\", Print];\n```\n\nBy clicking on the appeared button you will see the message from the Kernel. This is how all GUI elements are made, apart from wrapping them into a functions, that generate uid's by its own. \n\n#### Making things fancier | View & Generator\nTaking the previous example, we can improve it a bit starting from the __view component__\n\n```js\n.js\ncore.CustomButtonView = async (args, env) => {\n  const options = await core._getRules(args, env);\n  const button = document.createElement('input');\n  button.type = \"button\";\n  button.value = options.Label;\n  button.addEventListener('click', ()=>{\n    server.emitt(options.Event, '\"Clicked!\"');\n  });\n\n  env.element.appendChild(button);\n}\n\nreturn null;\n```\n\nNow this is a proper frontend function. Now it comes to __event-generator__\n\n```mathematica\nCustomButton[label_] := With[{uid = CreateUUID[]},\n  EventObject[<|\"id\"->uid, \"initial\"->False, \"view\"->CustomButtonView[\"Label\"->label, \"Event\"->uid]|>]\n]\n```\n\nThen we can use `CustomButton` as a real GUI component for user's input\n\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[CustomButton[\"Woo\"], Print]\n```\n\n## Cutting corners\nFor lazy people there are many shortcuts implemented\n\n___Aliases___\nThere are many ways to tell the same\n\n```mathematica\nEventBind[ev, Print]\nEventHandlet[ev, Print]\nPrint // ev\n```\n\n```mathematica\nDelete[ev]\nDeleteObject[ev]\n```\n\n___Fast event binding___\nThere is an another, sorter way of writing `EventHandler`\n```mathematica\nPrint // ev\n```\nwhich is basically \n```mathematica\nEventHandler[ev, Print]\n```\n\n___Assignment handler function___ \nSometimes it is too repetitive to write every-time `var = # &`, instead\n```mathematica\nev // Assign[x]\n```\nis basically an equivalent of \n```mathematica\nEventHandler[ev, (x = # &)]\n```\n\n___Fire an event manually___\nsometimes comes handy, when you want to initialize the data\n```mathematica\nev = EventObject[<|\"id\"->\"evid\", ...|>]\nEventFire[ev, 1+1]\n```\nor with no-data provided\n```mathematica\nEventFire[ev]\n```\nor just by using text-string\n```mathematica\nEventFire[\"event-id\"]\n```\n\n___Reference by id___\nif you know an `uid` of the event, but don't have a real `EventObject`\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[\"evid\", Print]\nEventRemove[\"evid\"]\nEventFire[\"evid\"]\nEventFire[\"evid\", 1+1]\n```\n\n---\n\n__[Download Notebook](Greyness.wln)__ \n\nAs well as the most part of WLJS Frontend, an event system was not carefully designed in-advance, but rather it was shaped and expanded iteratively via solving hundreds of practical cases."

Recently I had an urge to make a nice figure for the Physical Review B paper.\n\nIn this post: __shadows__, __light-sources__, __toon-shading__, __transformation control__...\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n\n\n\n<Component>\nhttps://cdn.statically.io/gh/JerryI/Mathematica-ThreeJS-graphics-engine/master/dist/kernel.js\n</Component>\n\n## Shadows\nFirstly, to depict a crystallographic structure is not a big deal. Using materials.project one can obtain `.cif` file and easily parse it using Wolfram Language. With a bit of a crystallography knowledge one can show ions as sphere with arbitrary colors and sizer for your taste \n\n\n\nOk, definitely, we __do not need spheres to cast shadows__...\nAh, by the way, some new features comes\n\n:::info\n```mathematica\nShadows[True]\n```\nAllows group of objects to cast shadows or receive them from the `PointLight`, `SpotLight`, `HemisphereLight` sources of light in the scene\n:::\n\n## Light sources\nTo define some custom light-source\n\n:::info\n```mathematica\nPointLight[RGBColor[], intensity_:1, ..., \"Position\"->{x,y,z}]\n```\nAdds point light source ([see THREE.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight))\n:::\n\n:::info\n```mathematica\nSpotLight[RGBColor[], intensity_:1, ..., \"Position\"->{x,y,z}, \"Target\"->{0,0,0}]\n```\nAdds spot light source ([see THREE.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/SpotLight))\n:::\n\n:::info\n```mathematica\nHemisphereLight[SkyColor_RGBColor, GroundColor_RGBColor, intensity_:1]\n```\nAdds hemisphere light source ([see THREE.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/HemisphereLight))\n:::\n\nThe position and target object support dynamic updates, i.e. one can do\n```mathematica\nPointLight[\"Position\"->(pos // Offload)]\n```\n\n:::tip\nTo have more control over the lighting, disable the default one in the scene\n```mathematica\nGraphics3D[..., Lighting->None]\n```\n:::\n\nLet me continue with a figure. __No shadows__ and __only point-light source__\n\n\n\nNow it's much better, however this old-school 3D look for me feels a bit off being printed next to sets of 2D plots.  \n\n## MeshMaterials\nVector graphics has a minimal set of colors, I am looking for something like this one\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![](screenshot-158_111793.jpg)\n\n*image from [CAHSEE - Properties of Shapes: Help and Review](https://study.com/academy/topic/cahsee-properties-of-shapes-help-and-review.html)*\n\n</div>\n\nWell, how one can archive that? It reminds me something\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![](Toon-shader.jpg)\n\n*image from [Cell shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel_shading)*\n\n</div>\n\nBrowsing through the materials on THREE.js docs, [I found one](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshToonMaterial) I was looking for and quickly applied that one\n\n\n\nHere we go! Let me introduce you `MeshMaterials`\n\n:::info\nUse `MeshMaterial[]` for a group of object to specify the material for the geometry. By the default, all objects have `MeshPhysicalMaterial[]`. \n\n```mathematica\nMeshMaterial[MeshPhysicalMaterial[]]\nMeshMaterial[MeshToonMaterial[]]\nMeshMaterial[MeshPhongMaterial[]]\nMeshMaterial[MeshLambertMaterial[]]\n```\n:::\n\nWell, I am not satisfied yet. \n\n## Transformation controls\nPositioning the light is pain. At least there is a dynamic binding, i.e. no need in re-evaluating a cell every-time. I wish, one could drag a light source like in Blender or any other 3D software.\n\nAs usual, everything [was invented before](https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_controls_transform), one only needs to adapt and integrate the given technology\n\n![](cTJTG9o.png)\n\nThe next logical step will be - implement it as a `EventHandler`, like `drag` or `click` listeners attached to an SVG element in `Graphics`\n\n:::info\nTo assign a draggable event handler used in 3D, apply handler for `transform` property\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[Sphere[], {\"transform\"->handler}]\n```\n`handler` function accepts an association with a current position of a dragged object\n```mathematica\n<|\"position\"->{x,y,z}|>\n```\n:::\n\nTo help with dragging an in-built gizmos will appear on-top of the attached object. Now it looks like this\n\n![](ezgif.com-optimize-11.gif)\n\n\nNow one can finally feel the freedom of positioning the light sources in the scene to achieve the best look\n\n\n\nProbably it won't work in the preview here in the post. To see it in action have a look at the thumbnail of this blog post or evaluate those three rows of a single cell in your notebook.\n\nNow I could finally overlay it with some notes and finished the look of a printed version\n\n![](Fig-1-01%201.svg)\n\nThanks for reading! See you soon"

      "content": "![](Screenshot%20from%202023-07-20%2020-04-08.png)\n\nThere is nothing more exciting in programming than designing a graphics application. Thankfully, there is one person on Github [Garrett Johnson](https://github.com/gkjohnson), who implemented a path-tracing algorithm on top of the well-known [THREE.js](https://threejs.org) graphics engine. Moreover, it fully supports features from the original library and can be anytime flipped as a main renderer.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nI hooked up his [library](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer) to works as a secondary engine for `Graphics3D` function presented in [wljs-graphics3d-threejs](https://github.com/JerryI/Mathematica-ThreeJS-graphics-engine) library. Just pass an option\n\n```mathematica\nGraphics3D[%, \"RTX\"->True]\n```\n\nAnd it will bake a realtime photorealistic image. It also supports all properties used in traditional rendering, i.e. `Emissive[]`, `Metallness[]`, HDRI map and many more!\n\nSome classical examples from Wolfram Mathematica\n\n![](IMG_0556.png)\n\n\n![](screenshot(8)%201.png)\n\nYou might recognize those examples from `Graphics3D` official documentation page. Here is some other neat pictures produced using the following code\n\n### Metallic maze\nThis was taken from the discussion [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/191047/making-holes-from-maze-generated-graphics3d). The maze is made from many polygons, where for the surface `Metallness[1], Roughness[0]` were applied. Since it provides perfect reflection, the overall time for rendering (when the noise has gone) is relatively low.\n\n```mathematica\nshowmaze = Uncompress[FromCharacterCode @@ ImageData[Import[\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XVJcP.png\"], \"Byte\"]];\nprims = CapsuleShape @@@ Cases[showmaze, _Cylinder, Infinity];\nprims = prims /. {{5., 5., 5.} -> {5.5, 5., 5.}, {1., 1., 1.} -> {1., 0.5, 1.}};\nims = RegionImage[#, {{0.3`, 5.7`}, {0.3`, 5.7`}, {0.3`, 5.7`}}, RasterSize -> 100] & /@ prims;\nim = ImageApply[Max, ims];\n```\n\nThen, the generated mesh is lit by `lighting` arrays, which contain randomly distributed glowing spheres\n\n```mathematica\nlighting = Table[{Emissive[RGBColor@@(RandomReal[{0,1}, 3]), 2], Sphere[RandomReal[{1,92}, 3], RandomReal[{1,7}]]}, {i, 1, 30}];\nShow[bmr = ImageMesh[im, Method -> \"DualMarchingCubes\"], PlotRange -> {{0, 91}, {1, 92}, {0, 91}}][[1]];\nGraphics3D[{lighting, Metalness[0], Roughness[0], %},  \"Lighting\"->None, ViewProjection->\"Perspective\", \"RTX\"->True]\n```\n\n\n![](screenshot(12).png)\n\nDespite the complicity of the scene, __it renders in real time__ with an acceptable amount of noise.\n\n### Torus Knot\nThis is rather classical example, but uses a glossy surface using `Roughness[0]` lit by two glowing spheres\n\n```mathematica\nKnotData[{\"TorusKnot\", {3, 5}}][[1]];\nGraphics3D[{{Emissive[Red, 5], Sphere[{0,0,-0.1}, 0.14]}, {Roughness[0],Cyan, %}, {Emissive[RGBColor[{1,1,1}], 5], Sphere[{0,0,0.4}, 0.1]}}, Lighting->None, \"RTX\"->True]\n```\n\nHere is the result\n\n![](screenshot(13).png)\n\nLooks like a dream...\n\n## Limitations\n- The dynamic scenes now are not supported, but can be added in theory according to the documentation of the path-rendering library. \n- Requires a dedicated GPU (actually with my Intel UHD integrated graphics it works, but demands an extremely long time to compile shaders to start rendering). However, iPhones, Androids can still handle not very complicated scenes.\n- Safari crashes (Firefox, Chrome, Vivaldi work well)"

Let us have a look at the original core first\n\n```mathematica\nFramed@DynamicModule[{points = {}, vel = {}}, \n  EventHandler[\n  \n   Graphics[{PointSize[0.1], \n\t   Point[Dynamic[{vel, points} = animate[vel, points]; points]]}\n\t, PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], \n   \n   \"MouseDown\" :> ({points, vel} = \n      addPoint[MousePosition[\"Graphics\"], points, vel])\n  ]\n]\n```\n\nIt uses `DynamicModule` to localize dynamic variables and a set of two functions `animate` to recalculate new positions and `addPoint`.\n\n[Download Notebook](Balls.nb)\n\n## WLJS Frontend version\n\nTo recreate this using WLJS Frontend we need to change the way how dynamics is processed. Firstly, we need an event-listener object to get the place where a user clicked\n\n```mathematica\nGraphics[{\n\tRGBColor[1,1,1],\n\tEventHandler[Rectangle[{-10,10},{10,-10}], {\"click\"->addPoint}],\n\tRGBColor[0,0,0], PointSize[0.1],\n\tPoint[points // Offload]\n}]\n```\n\nHere it creates a white rectangle in the background to add event-listener for clicks. And a global variable `points` is bounded to `Point` expression using `Offload`.\n\n:::danger\n`EventHandler` expression does not fully correspond to the one used in Wolfram Mathematica\n:::\n\n:::info\nDynamic binding is possible only using global variables.\n:::\n\nThen, we need an function, that adds dots to an array\n\n```mathematica\npoints = {{0,0}};\nvel = {RandomReal[{-1,1}]};\n\naddPoint[xy_] := (points = Append[points, xy]; vel = Append[vel, RandomReal[{-1,1},2]]);\n```\n\nNow it should add new dots, when we click on a canvas\n\n![](ezgif.com-video-to-gif-17.gif)\n\n\nOne thing is missing - animation. One need to update `points` symbol with a new positions and etc. The corresponding function will be\n\n```mathematica\npoints = {{0,0}};\nvel = {RandomReal[{-1,1}]};\n\naddPoint[xy_] := (points = Append[points, xy]; vel = Append[vel, RandomReal[{-1,1},2]]);\n\nanimate[i_] := points = MapIndexed[(If[Max[#1//Abs] > 1.2, vel[[#2//First]] = - vel[[#2//First]]]; #1 + 0.1 vel[[#2//First]])&, points];\n```\n\nInstead of using timers, one can assign the an event handler to the transition animation, which is provided by [wljs-graphics-d3](https://github.com/JerryI/wljs-graphics-d3) library. \n:::info\nIO operations between the frontend and a server cannot run at full speed giving 60FPS, therefore the data is interpolated using the time-constant provided by the option to the `Graphics` expression called `\"TransitionDuration\"`.\n:::\n\nTo capture the transitions we need a `MiddlewareHandler`\n\n```mathematica\nPoint[MiddlewareHandler[points//Offload, \"end\"->animate, \"Threshold\"->0.2]]\n```\n\nIt stands in between the drawing function and an updatable symbol. Threshold value specifies when the event `animate` will be fired, i.e. `1` means after the transition and anything less means, that it will be fired a bit early. It is used to compensate the latency of the network making the animation smoother. \n\nHere the full code\n\n\n\nLinks\n- [Download Notebook](Balls.wln)\n\nThanks for reading! See you next time"

What if we want to implement __real-time visualization with a least  $\\sim 30FPS$ ?__\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## Interpolation\nA standard library [wljs-graphics-d3](https://github.com/JerryI/wljs-graphics-d3) based on D3.js provides a decent transition mechanism, that makes a nice animated transitions from the old dataset to a new one perfectly in-sync with browser's refresh rate.\n\nLet us have a look at the example __with no interpolation involved__\n\n```mathematica\np = {-1,0};\nGraphics[{PointSize[0.1], Point[{p} // Offload]}, \"TransitionDuration\"->0.1]\n```\n\nBy updating the position \n\n```mathematica\nDo[\n  p = {x, Cos[10 x]}; \n  \n  (* simulate load *)\n  Pause[0.2];\n, {x,-1,1,0.1}]\n```\n\nwe will see the following\n\n![](ezgif.com-video-to-gif-19.gif)\n\nTo __enable the interpolation__ specify `TransitionDuration`\n\n```mathematica\nGraphics[{Cyan, PointSize[0.1],Point[{p} // Offload]}, ImageSize->{600,100}, \"TransitionDuration\"->300, \"TransitionType\"->\"Linear\"]\n```\n\nNow the transition time overlaps with our `Pause[0.2]` time period, that results in a kinda smooth behaviour. \n\n![](ezgif.com-video-to-gif-20.gif)\n\nThis approach might work well in a case, __when there is only one object to animate__.\n\n## Event-based approach\n\nHaving a fixed time delay and a loop in general __is a waste of resources__, especially when it comes to many independent animations. \n\nOne can assign all animations to the framerate of the browser, however doing that in a one directional way will introduce some issues, if the calculation time temporary exceeds the given time-window for render.\n\nSince we anyway are using [Interpolation](#Interpolation), one can use its local time-scale to call the next animation frame to be calculated (or data points will be updated).\n\nAssuming *$t_{calc} \\approx t_{transition}$ then we introduce a threshold value (0-1) that specifies, when the event of recalculating the position fires with respect to the duration of transition animation\n\n*threshold = 0.9*\n![](ezgif.com-video-to-gif-22.gif)\n*threshold = 0.5*\n![](ezgif.com-video-to-gif-23.gif)\n*threshold = 0.1*\n![](ezgif.com-video-to-gif-24.gif)\n\nThe good thing about it is that \n:::info\nA new transition will not occur if the calculation has not finished. \n:::\n\nA threshold and transition duration values can be adjusted to get the maximum smoothness and performance based on the network conditions and CPU load.\n\n### Implementation\nOne need to have an access to the transition process happening at the particular graphics element? Why not just\n\n```mathematica\nEventHandler[Point[p // Offload], \"transition\"->calc] ???\n```\n\nHere is why.\n\nFor the perspective of Javascript D3.js library used in frontend, when one calls\n\n*regular evaluation*\n```mathematica\nPoint[p // Offload]\n```\n```javascript\n> d3.Selection<SVGElement, unknown, HTMLElement, any>\n```\n\n*update method*\n```mathematica\nPoint[p // Offload]\n```\n```javascript\n> d3.Transition<GElement extends BaseType, Datum, PElement extends BaseType, PDatum>\n```\n\nHere one could attach to the returned object via\n\n```javascript\n(object) => {\n\tlet state = false;\n\tobject.tween(uid, function (d) {\n\t\treturn function (t) {\n\t\t\tif (t >= threshold && !state) {\n\t\t\t\tserver.emitt(uid, `True`);\n\t\t\t\tstate = true;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}))\n}\n```\n\nYou have to attach it every-time when a transition occur, since each time this is a new object.\n\nHowever, there is a problem\n\n:::info\nDynamic binding happens only between containers (virtual or real), i.e. `p` and `Point` expressions\n\n```mathematica\nOurHandler[Point[p // Offload]] // Graphics\n```\n\nThe upper expression `Point` scopes all variables. When `p` updates, `OurHandler` or `Graphics` expression __will not be evaluated__!\n:::\n\nIt means, that in general `EventHandler` method, where the event-binding is executed from outside to inside works well for the static evaluation, but events generated during dynamic updates will not be captured!\n\n__We need to bind from inside__\n\n```mathematica\nPoint[MiddlewareHandler[p // Offload, \"end\"->calc]] // Graphics\n```\n\nNow the whole expression `Point` including all its guts will be evaluated during the dynamic updates of any inner expressions.\n\nWith some tweaked added to the WLJS Interpreter, I (@JerryI) managed to make it work properly as intended. \n\n### How to use\nThere is only one event type has been implemented by now.\n\n```mathematica\nPoint[MiddlewareHandler[data // Offload, \"end\"->calc, \"Threshold\"->0.5]] // Graphics\n```\n\nor\n\n```mathematica\nLine[MiddlewareHandler[data // Offload, \"end\"->calc, \"Threshold\"->0.5]]\n```\n\nor even for the transformations\n\n```mathematica\nTranslate[MiddlewareHandler[Point[{0,0}], \"end\"->calc], data // Offload]\n```\n\nwhere\n\n```mathematica\ncalc[garbage_] := data = recalculate[data];\n```\n\n:::tip\nPlace `MiddlewareHandler` inside any expression, of which you want to track the transition process. It acts as `Identity` operator, i.e. allows safely wrapping around any other expression. \n:::\n\n:::info\n`MiddlewareHandler` fires the first (zero) event just when it has been created\n:::\n\n## Making 2D Game\nNow we can use this trick for any projectiles in game animations! Each created object will be handled by its own `MiddlewareHandler`\n\n\n\nDownload notebook\n- [Baster.wln](Baster.wln)"

Since the context of executing is stored together with an object, one can simply evaluate (in-place) the needed expression.\n<!--truncate-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's have a look at the following example\n\n```mathematica\nPlot[Sin[x], {x,0,Pi}, Epilog->{MetaMarker[\"myplot\"]}]\n```\n\nHere it results in `Graphics` expressions with a bunch of `Line` lying inside, while `Epilog` option just puts the given expression into the end of the same `Graphics` object.\n\n![](Screenshot%202023-07-14%20at%2015.36.32.png)\n\nYou can think about `MetaMarker` as if it was `<div id=\"\">` or class, that allows you to identify that particular object in the given context.\n\nAfter than one can simply execute an expression by using the following expression\n\n```mathematica\nFrontSubmit[{\n\tRGBColor[1,0,1], \n\tLine[{{0,0},{0.4,1}}]\n}, MetaMarker[\"myplot\"]] \n```\n\n:::info\nUsing `FrontSubmit` together with the second argument given as `MetaMarker` will result in evaluation of the expression on frontend in the context and local memory of the marked excutable object.\n:::\n\nAs a result, the graph will show a new feature\n\n![](Screenshot%202023-07-14%20at%2015.37.00.png)\n\nThis does not depend on `Graphics` object, it can be anything in principle.\n\n## Voxel cellular automaton\nFor example, let us create an empty 3D canvas\n\n```mathematica\nGraphics3D[{Cuboid[{1,1,0}], MetaMarker[\"marker\"]},  \"Lighting\"->None, \"Lightmap\"->\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerryI/Mathematica-ThreeJS-graphics-engine/master/assets/PureSky.hdr\", \"ViewProjection\"->\"Perspective\"]\n```\n\nThen using build-in cellular automaton, we can visualize it lively in 3D using simple `Cuboid` shapes with different colors\n\n```mathematica\nsize = {10,10};\nboard = CellularAutomaton[{6, {2, 1}, {1, 1}}, {{{1}}, 0}, 50]//First;\nsize = board//Dimensions\n\nz = 20;\n\niterate := (\n board = CellularAutomaton[{6, {2, 1}, {1, 1}}, board];\n\n Table[\n  If[board[[i+size[[1]]/2 // Floor,j+size[[2]]/2 // Floor]] > 0, \n    With[{cube = Cuboid[{i,j,z}, {i+1,j+1,z+0.8}], color = {1+i/100,1+i/100,(z+10)/10}},\n    \n      FrontSubmit[{ RGBColor@color, cube}, MetaMarker[\"marker\"]];\n      Pause[0.02];\n      \n    ]\n  ];\n , {i, -size[[1]]/2//Floor, size[[1]]/2//Floor}, {j, -size[[2]]/2//Floor, size[[2]]/2//Floor}];\n z = z - 0.8;\n);\n```\n\nIf a cell is 1, then it will be a cube on that place. By calling\n\n```mathematica\nDo[iterate //Quiet;, {i,1,10}];\n```\n\nOne can observe in real time the following\n\n![](ezgif.com-optimize-10.gif)\n\nThe full code is presented below\n\n\n\nYou can also download this notebook via a link\n- [VoxelAutomata.wln](VoxelAutomata.wln)\n\nThank you for reading!
