## Highlights


### Not a typical Jupyter-like notebook environment

It supports dynamics, GUI building blocks, and powerful Mathematica syntax out of the box.

No more static graphics! Each primitive of `Graphics`/`Graphics3D` was recreated from scratch using `d3.js` and `THREE.js` libraries. Most native plotting functions of Mathematica are supported.

#### AI Assistant
We deeply integrated ChatGPT, so that AI can have a read/write acccess to your notebook

### Command Palette and GUI-in-Code Emulation
#### Inline Dynamic Tool for Tuning 2D/3D Positions

### Native Math Input in the Code Editor
Write beautiful equations between lines of normal Wolfram Language expressions.

### Compress to HTML
An entire notebook can be exported to a standalone `.html` file keeping all data inside. __No internet dependency, no additional software__ is required for viewing a notebook

Later, once opened using WLJS Notebook application, it is unpacked back to a normal editable format.

### Data-Driven Slides
Make a presentation right from the notebook.

### Real-Time Interactivity
Follows the mouse pointer and performs complex calculations.

WLJS Notebook __runs locally__ and belongs to you (no cloud-based stuff involved). __No internet connection is needed__.

## Motivation
The idea is to implement a minimalistic but easily extendable open-source notebook interface with syntax sugar, interactive objects for the freeware Wolfram Engine.

__There is no aim to fully copy Mathematica__ (it will never be possible), however, there are a few things that can be improved:

- __Stability__ and speed
- Independence from WRI
- Portability (not PDF) - easy to share your work with someone outside the ecosystem __keeping your graphics interactive__ or embedded on a website
- Event-based approach to dynamics - allow users to __build complex dynamic notebooks__ and to have clear control over all moving parts
- Natural bridge between other languages - HTML as markup, WL for computations, and JS for stunning visuals

# Installation
[The freeware Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) is required (Version 13.3 is preferable).

## Desktop App
Download from the __[releases](https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend/releases)__ section.

## Standalone Server
Clone this repository and run:

```shell
wolframscript -f Scripts/start.wls
```

or on a specific hostname

```shell
wolframscript -f Scripts/start.wls host 0.0.0.0 http 8080 ws 8081 ws2 8082 docs 8085
```

that will open __an HTTP server__ on `8080` port with `8081`, `8082` __used for realtime communication__ and __docs pages__ at `8085`

## Package System

The frontend uses its own package/plugin system. It doesn't require any software installed except wolframscript. Precompiled plugins are downloaded using URLFetch from GitHub repositories and imported to the system.
